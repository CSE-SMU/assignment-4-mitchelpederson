# Assignment 4 Postmortem

## What's your name?
Mitchel Pederson


## How difficult was this assignment?
It was difficult up front since I missed the first two AngularJS days in class, but once I got the hang of the basic parts of it and found some decent tutorials, it was pretty easy.


## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?
I have never used AngularJS before, so being able to do anything with it is new.


## How could this assignment be improved?
Give a couple hints on what kinds of controllers might be used, or what directives or components are needed. 


## Any other comments?
I used a codepen todo list example as a reference: http://codepen.io/Russbrown/pen/IgBuh?editors=1010
Other than that, I only used the AngularJS documentation.
